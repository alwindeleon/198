1. why use Weighted Least Squares Filtter?
"Disparity map filter based on Weighted Least Squares filter (in form of Fast Global Smoother that is a lot faster than traditional Weighted Least Squares filter implementations) and optional use of left-right-consistency-based confidence to refine the results in half-occlusions and uniform areas."


2. explain why use SGBM?


3. explain used method for 3d reconstruction from point clouds
-automatically computes this : https://i.stack.imgur.com/CAm76.png

do it specifically for sea bed!!!

adjust focal length/lambda/sigma


decide on a topic


MY TOPIC: 3D Reconstruction of Seabed using Stereo Vision
Proposed method: foreground extraction using grabcut -> sgbm -> wls filtering -> linear triangulation
